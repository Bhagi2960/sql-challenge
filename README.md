The purpose of this project was to design a database to hold employee data for a company that had the employee data saved in CSV files. Six CSV files were
used and imported into a PostgresQL database.
The corresponding tables were created as employees, titles, departments, dept_emp, dept_manager and salaries. 

An ER diagram was created using QuickDBD to dsiplay the relationships based on primary keys and foreign keys. ER diagram attached.

The database was queried to find detailed information on employees and it is included in the quieries.sql file and the table schema creation sql code is included in the schema.sql file.
